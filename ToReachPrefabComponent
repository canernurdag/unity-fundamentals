To reach components of prefab that will be created later, there are two useful ways, except for singleton, static and injection.
1st way is using "GameObject.Find, Object.FindObjectOfType, Object.FindObjectWithTags" etc. This is an easy way to implement but not very efficient regarding performance issues.
2nd way is creating details when Instantiate command occurs; 
    [Serializefield] => GameObject which you would like to use it's  components in the prefab's scripts.
    In Start or Awake => AddComponent, GetComponent, and equals the GameObjects, one is from Serializefield, one is from prefab's script.
    Then reach functions, parametres etc.
